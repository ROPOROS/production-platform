# Infrastructure Layer

This directory contains infrastructure definitions and configuration required to provision and operate the platform.

Infrastructure is managed using Infrastructure as Code principles to ensure:
- Reproducibility across environments
- Minimal configuration drift
- Clear version control and change history

The infrastructure layer evolves to include runtime environments, supporting services, and platform dependencies as the project progresses.
