# CI/CD Layer

This directory defines the continuous integration and delivery workflows for the platform.

The CI/CD pipelines are responsible for:
- Validating application changes
- Building and packaging artifacts
- Enforcing security and quality gates
- Automating deployments to the runtime environment

The pipelines are designed to fail fast, surface actionable feedback, and support safe rollback strategies.
