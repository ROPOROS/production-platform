# Application Layer

This directory contains the application used to simulate a real-world service operated by the platform.

The application represents a typical backend service exposed over HTTP, designed to:
- Be containerized and deployed in a Kubernetes environment
- Emit basic metrics for observability
- Serve as a target for reliability, performance, and failure testing

The application itself is intentionally simple; the focus of this project is on platform engineering and operational practices rather than application feature complexity.
